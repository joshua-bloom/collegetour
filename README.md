College Tour iPhone project (2011)

Created as a final project for iOS Development (CS90) at Swarthmore w/ Josh Bloom. This app allowed users to keep track of the colelges they visited. The evaluation takes into account inforrmation such as weather, tourguide, dorms, food, athletics, academics, college town. It also gives the user the ability to take pictures and write notes about each college.

After the tour is finished, each college tour experience is visible in a simple summary view and can be exported via email to parents, friends, college counselors, etc. Additionaly, the app implements a rating system based upon a users preferences to estimate how much the user liked each tour.


The app College Tours was on the store from May 2011 to May 2012 and recieved around 10k downloads. Please email for screen shots.
